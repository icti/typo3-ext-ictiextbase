/**
 * This view helper generates a <select> dropdown list for the use with a form.
 *
 * = Basic usage =
 *
 * The most straightforward way is to supply an associative array as the "options" parameter.
 * The array key is used as option key, and the value is used as human-readable name.
 *
 * <code title="Basic usage">
 * <f:form.select name="paymentOptions" options="{payPal: 'PayPal International Services', visa: 'VISA Card'}" />
 * </code>
 *
 * = Pre-select a value =
 *
 * To pre-select a value, set "value" to the option key which should be selected.
 * <code title="Default value">
 * <f:form.select name="paymentOptions" options="{payPal: 'PayPal International Services', visa: 'VISA Card'}" value="visa" />
 * </code>
 * Generates a dropdown box like above, except that "VISA Card" is selected.
 *
 * If the select box is a multi-select box (multiple="true"), then "value" can be an array as well.
 *
 * = Usage on domain objects =
 *
 * If you want to output domain objects, you can just pass them as array into the "options" parameter.
 * To define what domain object value should be used as option key, use the "optionValueField" variable. Same goes for optionLabelField.
 * If neither is given, the Identifier (UID/uid) and the __toString() method are tried as fallbacks.
 *
 * If the optionValueField variable is set, the getter named after that value is used to retrieve the option key.
 * If the optionLabelField variable is set, the getter named after that value is used to retrieve the option value.
 *
 * <code title="Domain objects">
 * <f:form.select name="users" options="{userArray}" optionValueField="id" optionLabelField="firstName" />
 * </code>
 * In the above example, the userArray is an array of "User" domain objects, with no array key specified.
 *
 * So, in the above example, the method $user->getId() is called to retrieve the key, and $user->getFirstName() to retrieve the displayed value of each entry.
 *
 * The "value" property now expects a domain object, and tests for object equivalence.
